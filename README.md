### Calculating Annual Returns
---
#### In this challenge, the macro created calculates the annual returns for each company with data for 2017 and 2018.  There is one input parameter, the analysis year, which is requested from the user with an input box.  
---
### Analysis Results
---
#### 2017 was a great year for this group of companies: all but one, TERP, had gains.  The company with the greatest gains in 2017 was DQ, Steve's parents' favorite ticker. 
---
#### 2018 was not such a great year, with all but two companies posting losses for the year.  The company with the greatest losses was DQ.
---
### Bottom Line
#### The two companies that had gains in both 2017 and 2018 were ENPH and RUN.  These may not be a bargain right now.  Further reading is advised for Steve's parents, the DQ duo.
